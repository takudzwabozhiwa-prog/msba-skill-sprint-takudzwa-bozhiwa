# Implementation Plan

## What does this repo do in plain language?
This repository provides a tool that allows users to view and interact with SQLite databases through a web browser. It makes it easier to explore tables, run SQL queries, and analyze stored data without needing complex database software.

## What would you need to change to use it for a real company?
To use this tool for a real company, I would connect it to the company’s production database that contains customer, transaction, or operational data. I would also ensure proper security settings so only authorized users can access the data.

## Proof of Use or Attempt
I reviewed the repository and learned how it can be used to explore and query SQLite databases. This tool would be useful for analytics tasks such as exploring customer data, validating data quality, and running SQL queries to support business analysis.
